# Hazelcast Node.js Client
Node.js Client for Hazelcast, using Hazelcast Open Client Protocol 1.0 for Hazelcast 3.6 and higher

**Hazelcast** is a clustering and highly scalable data distribution platform.

With its various distributed data structures, distributed caching capabilities, elastic nature and more importantly with so many happy users, Hazelcast is feature-rich, enterprise-ready and developer-friendly in-memory data grid solution.
